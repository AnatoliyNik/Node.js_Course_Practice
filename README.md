# Node.js_Course_Practice

This Node.js application is written in Typescript, uses Express.js and MongoDB, 
and includes APIs for "Movies" and "Genres". It allows searching movies by genre.


## Running the app

Make sure all dependencies are installed by running the command `npm install`

```
#production mode
npm run start

#development mode
npm run dev
```

## Testing the app

```
# unit test 
npm run test

# watch mode
npm run test:watch

# test coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

- After the tests have completed, a summary of the results will be displayed, 
showing the number of tests passed and any errors or warnings encountered.

- If the test results indicate that all tests have passed, it means that the code 
is functioning correctly and meets the expected behavior.

- If there are any errors or warnings, pay attention to the corresponding messages 
and address any issues in the code.

- For more detailed information about test results or code coverage, 
you can use additional commands such as `npm run test:coverage` or `npm run test:watch`.
